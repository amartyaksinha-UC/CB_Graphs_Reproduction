This repository contains my work to help my partner reproduce certain graphs from College Board's Education Pays 2023 report (part of TRENDS IN HIGHER EDUCATION SERIES) but for the state of Illinois.
I have primarily used RStudio for all data analysis, and data sources for the graphs I worked on are from the IPUMS_CPS website.

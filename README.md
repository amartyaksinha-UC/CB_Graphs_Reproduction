This repository contains my work to help my partner out with a work commitment involving replicating graphs from College Board's Education Pays 2023 report (part of TRENDS IN HIGHER EDUCATION SERIES). 
I have primarily used RStudio for all data analysis, and data sources for the graphs I worked on are from the IPUMS_CPS website.
